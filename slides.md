1. **Start with a Personal Pain Point**

    - Solve a problem you deeply understand

2. **Iterate Quickly and Embrace Feedback:**

    - Build in public and listen to your users

3. **Be Resilient and Adaptable:**

    - Challenges are opportunities in disguise

<div class="qr-code"></div>

---

**1. Start with Problem/Desire, Not App**

    -   No one cares about your app
    -   Everyone cares about themselves

**2. Talk About Outcomes, Not Features**

    -   No one wants to do stuff
    -   Everyone wants to get stuff

**3. Remove Screens Until You Can't Anymore**

    -   Do the steps for the user (if possible)
    -   So they need to do less (not more)

**4. Don't Add Long Texts. Make UI Better**

    -   Needs long explanation? → Needs rework
    -   Make it simpler → no explanation needed

<div class="qr-code"></div>

---

**5. Launch MVP in 4 Weeks**

    -   One core action is all you need
    -   Fast launch → fast results

**6. Educate & Elevate During Onboarding**

    -   Not a time to bore users with features
    -   Teach them, you're the expert

**7. Show Paywall After Onboarding**

    -   60% of subscribers do so during onboarding
    -   Others got rich this way, you'll too

**8. Stop Adding Features. Make UX Better**

    -   Best apps? They're easy to use
    -   More features isn't always better

---

**9. First 3 Months: Find & Solve Bottlenecks**

    -   Go top to bottom (App Store → app)
    -   Lift conversion rate of every step

**10. 1%+ Subscribe? Now Bring More Users**

    -   You validated your app idea
    -   Now it's time to pour more water in
